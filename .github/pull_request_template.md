Welcome to the PR tracker for **JuCC**! We're excited that you're interested in improving our system.

**PRs that do not follow our guidelines** will be immediately closed. In general, you should avoid creating a PR until you are reasonably confident the tests should pass, having tested locally first.

Please choose the appropriate labels on the Github panel and feel free to assign yourself. Additionally, if your PR solves an open issue, please link the issue on the Github panel. Feel free to assign reviewers to your PR or we will decide who best to assign for a review.

# Heading
Please choose an appropriate heading for your PR, relevant to the changes you have made.

## Description
Please create a description of the issue your PR solves, and how you went about implementing your solution.

### Remaining Tasks
Again, you should only create PR once you are reasonably confident you are near completion. However, if there are some tasks still remaining before the PR is ready to merge, please create a checklist to track active progress.
:pushpin: TODOs:
- [x] ~~Stash limit in Parser for pushdown (INVALID)~~
- [x] Add optional property support
- [ ] Fix memory leaks

## Further Work
If your PR unlocked the potential for further improvement, please note them here and create additional issues! Do the same if you discovered bugs in the process of development.
